# ECSE211 Lab 4 - Localization

This is your repository for the fourth lab. You must place your source files in the 
`src/ca/mcgill/ecse211/lab4/` folder, where `Main.java` is. Your source files
must all have the package declaration 

```java
package ca.mcgill.ecse211.lab4;
```

**Do not modify the other files in this repository!**

They are meant to help us (and you) with grading the code.

For more information on connecting this repository to your local Eclipse installation,
please refer to the [Clean Code Tutorial](https://mcgill-ecse211-f19.github.io/getting_started_guide/CleanCodeTutorial-F19#step-by-step-instructions)
(modify the steps for lab 4 as needed).
