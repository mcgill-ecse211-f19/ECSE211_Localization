# ECSE211 Lab 4 - Localization

This is your repository for the fourth lab. You must place your source files in the 
`src/ca/mcgill/ecse211/lab4/` folder, where `Main.java` is. Your source files
must all have the package declaration 

```java
package ca.mcgill.ecse211.lab4;
```

**Do not modify the other files in this repository!**

They are meant to help us (and you) with grading the code. You can see the results
of `checkstyle` at

travis-ci.com/mcgill-ecse211-f19/lab-4-ecse211_gXX

where XX is 
your group number. You may also run `checkstyle` locally before you commit by running

```bash
./gradlew checkstyle
```

on your local machine from the repo root directory.

For more information on connecting this repository to your local Eclipse installation,
please refer to the [Clean Code Tutorial](https://mcgill-ecse211-f19.github.io/getting_started_guide/CleanCodeTutorial-F19#step-by-step-instructions)
(modify the steps for lab 4 as needed).
